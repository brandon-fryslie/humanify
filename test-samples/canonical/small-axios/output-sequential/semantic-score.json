  "explanation": "The deobfuscated names show a moderate understanding of the original identifiers. Some names like 'ArrayBuffer', 'globalThis', and 'requestHeaders' are correctly identified, indicating a grasp of certain key concepts. However, many names are overly generic or incorrect, such as 'inputValue', 'inputString', and 'error', which do not capture the specific semantic meaning of the original identifiers like 'AxiosError' or 'CancelToken'. The presence of generic names like 'inputValue' and 'inputString' suggests a lack of precision in capturing the specific roles or functions of these identifiers in the code. Overall, while there is some semantic alignment, the deobfuscation lacks specificity and accuracy in many cases.",
