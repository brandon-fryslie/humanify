  "explanation": "The deobfuscated names show a moderate understanding of the original identifiers. Some names like 'ArrayBuffer', 'globalThis', and 'requestHeaders' are correctly identified, indicating a grasp of certain key concepts. However, many names are overly generic or incorrect, such as '________________inputValue' and '____error', which do not capture the specific semantic meaning of the original identifiers. There are also instances where the AI-generated names are too verbose or lack precision, such as 'httpHeaderHandler' instead of 'headers'. Overall, while there is some alignment with the original semantics, a significant portion of the names are generic or misrepresentative, leading to a moderate score.",
