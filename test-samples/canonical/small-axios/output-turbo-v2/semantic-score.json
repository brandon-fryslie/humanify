  "explanation": "The deobfuscated names show a moderate understanding of the semantic meaning of the code. Some names are well-matched, such as 'ArrayBuffer', 'Symbol', and 'WorkerGlobalScope'. However, there are several instances where the names are either too generic or incorrect, such as 'BlobTypeChecker' for 'AxiosURLSearchParams', 'CharacterCategories' for 'CancelToken', and 'DIGIT_CHARACTERS' for '_arrayWithHoles'. Additionally, some names like 'HttpRequestError' and 'HttpStatus' are not present in the original identifiers, indicating potential misinterpretations. Overall, while there is some alignment, there are enough discrepancies to suggest only a moderate level of semantic understanding.",
