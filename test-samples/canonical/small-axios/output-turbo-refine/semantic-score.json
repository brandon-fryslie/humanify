  "score": 65,
  "explanation": "The deobfuscated names show a moderate understanding of the original identifiers. Some names are semantically equivalent or close synonyms, such as 'contentType' and 'error'. However, many names are generic or incorrect, such as 'inputObject' and 'inputValue', which do not capture the specific meaning of the original identifiers like '_FormData' or 'arg1'. There are also instances where the deobfuscated names are overly verbose or not specific enough, such as 'httpRequestConfig' for '_config'. Overall, while there is some semantic alignment, there are enough generic or incorrect names to warrant a moderate score.",
