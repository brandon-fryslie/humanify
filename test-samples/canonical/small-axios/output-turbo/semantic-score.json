  "explanation": "The deobfuscated names show a poor understanding of the semantic meaning of the original identifiers. Many names are overly generic or incorrect, such as using 'inputValue' for various unrelated identifiers and 'error' for multiple distinct error-related identifiers. While some names like 'ArrayBuffer' and 'FormData' are correctly identified, the majority are not semantically equivalent to the original names. The deobfuscator often resorts to generic terms like 'inputValue', 'event', and 'error', which do not capture the specific roles or meanings of the original identifiers.",
