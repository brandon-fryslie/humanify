  "explanation": "The deobfuscated names generally capture the semantic meaning of the original identifiers, with many names being close synonyms or reasonable interpretations (e.g., 'arrayFormatFunction' for 'arrayFormat', 'encoderFunction' for 'encoder'). However, there are several instances where the names are more generic or slightly off, such as 'currentFilterableKey' for 'key', 'elementToAdd' for 'push', and 'processedResults' for 'stringify'. These discrepancies indicate a good but not perfect semantic understanding, warranting a score in the 70-89 range.",
