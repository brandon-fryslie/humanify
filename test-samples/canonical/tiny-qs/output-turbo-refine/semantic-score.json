  "explanation": "The AI-generated names generally capture the semantic meaning of the original identifiers, with many names being clear and descriptive. For example, 'arrayFormatHandlers' and 'arrayFormatPreference' are good matches for 'arrayFormat' and 'arrayPrefixGenerators'. However, there are some misses, such as '_____inputValue' and 'primitiveInputValue' which are less clear compared to 'value' and 'valueOrArray'. Additionally, some names like 'cyclicReferenceTrackerMap' and 'sideChannelInstance' are more complex than necessary, potentially obscuring their purpose. Overall, the deobfuscator demonstrates a good semantic understanding with minor inaccuracies.",
