  "explanation": "The deobfuscated names generally capture the semantic meaning of the original identifiers, with many names being close synonyms or descriptive of their function. For example, 'adjustedPrefix' is similar to 'formattedKey', and 'allowDots' is similar to 'isDotsAllowed'. However, there are some misses, such as '_____inputValue' for 'value', which is overly generic, and 'eventObject' for 'obj', which could be misleading. Overall, the AI demonstrates a good understanding of the code's semantics, but there are several instances where the names could be more precise or better aligned with the original intent.",
