  "explanation": "The deobfuscated names show a moderate understanding of the original identifiers. Some names like 'allowDots', 'charset', and 'formats' are correctly captured, indicating a grasp of the semantic meaning. However, many names are generic or incorrect, such as '__currentObjectValue', '_event', and 'inputValue', which do not clearly convey the specific roles or actions of the original identifiers like 'adjustedPrefix', 'allowEmptyArrays', or 'encodeDotInKeys'. The use of generic terms like 'currentValue' and 'currentItem' further detracts from the semantic clarity. Overall, while there is some alignment, the deobfuscation lacks precision in capturing the specific functions and roles of the original identifiers.",
