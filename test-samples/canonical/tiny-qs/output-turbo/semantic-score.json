  "explanation": "The deobfuscated names demonstrate a good semantic understanding of the original identifiers, with many names capturing the intended meaning. However, there are several instances where the names are either too generic or slightly off in terms of specificity. For example, '__currentObjectValue' and '_currentObjectValue' are used multiple times, which could lead to confusion. Some names like 'cyclicCheckCounter' and 'isCyclicValue' are more descriptive than necessary, while others like 'event' and 'handleEvent' are too generic. Overall, the AI-generated names reflect a reasonable grasp of the code's semantics, but there are areas for improvement in specificity and consistency.",
