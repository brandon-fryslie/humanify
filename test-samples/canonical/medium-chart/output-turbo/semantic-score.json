  "explanation": "The deobfuscated names show a poor understanding of the semantic meaning of the original identifiers. Many names are generic or incorrect, such as '__________________________________________________________________________currentIndex' and '________________________cachedMeta', which do not convey meaningful information. There are also instances of overly generic names like 'dataElement', 'element', and 'valueScale', which do not capture the specific roles these identifiers play in the code. While some names like 'Animation' and 'canvasContext' are correct, the overall quality is low, with many identifiers being either too generic or completely off the mark.",
