  "explanation": "The deobfuscated names often fail to capture the semantic meaning of the original identifiers. Many names are overly generic (e.g., 'dataElement', 'element', 'options') or incorrect (e.g., 'Colors' for 'BasePlatform', 'PolarAreaController' for 'DatasetController'). While some names are contextually appropriate, such as 'animationControllerInstance' for 'Animation', the majority do not accurately reflect the original intent or functionality, leading to a poor understanding of the code's semantics.",
