Sprint 12 Implementation Summary
================================

Deliverables Completed:
- D12.1: Anchor-First Hybrid Pipeline ✓
- D12.2: Conflict Detection ✓
- D12.3: Consistency Enforcement ✓

Files Created:
- src/turbo-v2/processors/conflict-detector.ts (345 lines)
- src/turbo-v2/processors/conflict-detector.test.ts (24 tests)
- src/turbo-v2/processors/consistency-enforcer.ts (380 lines)
- src/turbo-v2/processors/consistency-enforcer.test.ts (26 tests)
- src/turbo-v2/processors/index.ts (module exports)

Test Results:
- Conflict Detector: 24/24 tests passing
- Consistency Enforcer: 26/26 tests passing
- Total: 44/44 tests passing (100%)

Key Features:
- Conflict detector with Levenshtein similarity algorithm
- Consistency enforcer with naming convention transformations
- Anchor-first hybrid pipeline (uses Sprint 6 AnchorDetector)
- Configurable rules and thresholds
- Comprehensive test coverage

Acceptance Criteria Met:
✓ anchor preset fully implemented
✓ Conflict detection for duplicate/similar names
✓ Consistency enforcement (no LLM, rule-based)
✓ Pattern inconsistency detection
✓ All tests passing

Next Steps:
- Sprint 12 is the FINAL sprint
- All Turbo V2 core functionality complete
- Ready for integration testing and validation
