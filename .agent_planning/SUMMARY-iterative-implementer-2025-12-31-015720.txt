Sprint 1 COMPLETE: Foundation & Backend API
===========================================

Delivered:
- TypeScript shared types (ExperimentConfig, SampleResult, etc.)
- JSON file storage with atomic writes (.humanify-experiments/experiments.json)
- Express REST API on localhost:3456:
  - GET /api/experiments (list all)
  - POST /api/experiments (create new)
  - GET /api/experiments/:id (get with results)
  - DELETE /api/experiments/:id (remove)
- Basic React frontend scaffold
- Vite + MUI dev setup
- Validation: Manual API testing via curl - all endpoints working

Remaining Sprints (2-4):
========================

Sprint 2: Experiment Runner Integration
- Implement POST /api/experiments/:id/run endpoint
- Execute turbo-v2 programmatically (import from ../cli/turbo-v2-command.ts)
- Call scoring after each sample completes
- Store results in storage
- Track status: pending -> running -> completed

Sprint 3: React Dashboard UI
- ExperimentList component with MUI DataGrid
- ExperimentForm dialog (name, preset dropdown, samples checkboxes)
- Run button with status polling
- StatusBadge component
- Full CRUD workflow in UI

Sprint 4: Comparison View & Polish
- Checkbox selection in experiment list
- CompareView component with MUI Table
- Delta calculations with color coding
- Delete confirmation dialog
- Error snackbar
- justfile recipe: `just experiment-dashboard`

Next Steps:
- Continue with Sprint 2 runner implementation
- Need to find/create sample files (tiny-qs, small-axios, medium-chart)
- Integrate with existing turbo-v2 execution code
- Add semantic scoring integration
