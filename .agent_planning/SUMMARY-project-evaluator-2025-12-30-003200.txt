Scope: project/full - Turbo V2 implementation
Completion: 0% (spec phase, no code) | Phase 0: 75% | Gaps: 6 critical
Reused: 3 FRESH findings from prior evaluations | Fresh: Complete file inspection
Cache updated: No new cache entries (no implementation to analyze)
Ambiguities: 3 new found (baseline scores, API key setup, missing turbo run)
Workflow: CONTINUE (gaps clear, resolution plan exists)

Key Findings:
- NO IMPLEMENTATION: Zero .ts files in src/turbo-v2/
- SPEC EXCELLENT: 543 lines, 85% complete, solid architecture
- PHASE 0 BLOCKED: Semantic scoring NEVER RUN (0/6 measurements)
- GAP 1 CRITICAL: Hypothesis unvalidated (30% risk of failure)
- GAP 6 CRITICAL: LLMRenameProcessor spec missing (blocks Phase 1)

Critical Path:
1. Run semantic scoring (4-6 hrs API time, ~$10)
2. Validate hypothesis (1-pass ≥60% sequential quality)
3. Resolve Gap 6 (add processor spec, 2-3 hrs)
4. Resolve Gaps 2-3 (terminology, metrics, 3 hrs)
5. Begin Phase 1 (14-18 hrs total to start)

Evidence:
- Baselines: 5/6 runs complete, all structural valid
- Scoring script: Exists (194 lines), never executed
- Gap resolution: Plan exists (PLAN-2025-12-29-235952.md)
- Risk: 30% hypothesis fails → architecture rethink

Next Action: User runs semantic scoring, validates hypothesis
