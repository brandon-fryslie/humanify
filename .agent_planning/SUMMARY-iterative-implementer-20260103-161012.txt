=== Summary ===

Successfully integrated the PassDetailView component into ExperimentDetail.tsx:

1. Added import for PassDetailView component
2. Added new "Passes" tab between "Results" and "Processing Log" tabs
3. Updated tab indices to accommodate new tab (Processing Log is now index 4)
4. Implemented conditional rendering: shows PassDetailView when a run is selected, otherwise shows info message
5. Passed required props (experimentId and runId) to PassDetailView
6. Updated auto-scroll logic for Processing Log tab (changed from index 3 to index 4)

TypeScript: No errors
Bundle size: 832.95 kB (warning about chunk size, but not blocking)

=== Integration Details ===

The Passes tab:
- Shows when tab index is 3
- Conditional rendering based on selectedRun state
- If selectedRun exists: renders PassDetailView with experimentId and runId props
- If no run selected: shows Alert message "Select a run from the 'Runs' tab to view pass details"
- PassDetailView internally handles loading passes and identifiers data
- PassDetailView includes IdentifierContextDialog for viewing identifier context from vault

=== User Workflow ===

1. Open experiment detail dialog
2. Click "Runs" tab and select a run (populates selectedRun state)
3. Click "Passes" tab to view pass-level details
4. Expand a pass to see identifier-level details
5. Click info icon on identifier to view context from vault

=== Definition of Done ===

All requirements met:
✓ PassDetailView imported and integrated
✓ New "Passes" tab appears between Results and Processing Log
✓ Tab indices correct for all tabs
✓ PassDetailView receives experimentId and runId props
✓ Conditional rendering when no run selected
✓ Build passes without errors
✓ No TypeScript errors
