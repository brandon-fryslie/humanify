Scope: feature/identifier-details-per-pass
Completion: 40% | Gaps: 3 major (context storage, API endpoints, UI components)
Reused: 0 findings | Fresh: All findings
Cache updated: 0 files (no general knowledge extracted - feature-specific evaluation)
Ambiguities: 3 found | Workflow: PAUSE (3 questions need answers first)

Key Findings:
1. Data Layer: COMPLETE for status/confidence, MISSING for context
2. API Layer: Endpoints don't exist, need 3 new routes
3. UI Layer: Components don't exist, need PassDetailView + IdentifierDetailDialog
4. CRITICAL: Context not stored - need decision on storage strategy before building

Blocking Questions:
- Q1: Context storage strategy (5 options, recommend hybrid approach)
- Q2: Performance requirements (10K+ identifiers, pagination vs virtualization)
- Q3: Priority (3 levels, 2-10 days depending on scope)

Recommendation: Start with Level 1 (identifier list without context) to unblock 60% of feature value, then decide on context storage based on actual usage patterns.
