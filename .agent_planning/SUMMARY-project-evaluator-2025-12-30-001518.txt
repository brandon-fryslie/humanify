Completion: 85% | Gaps: 6 critical | Test Quality: N/A (spec evaluation)
Ambiguities: 3 found | Workflow: APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS
STATUS-2025-12-30-001518.md written

Verdict: APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS
- Excellent architecture (Ledger+Vault, multi-pass, checkpointing)
- 6 critical gaps remain (documented in PLAN-2025-12-29-235952.md)
- Phase 0 validation MUST complete before implementation starts
- Estimated 12-16 hours to resolve all gaps

Critical blockers:
1. Gap 1: Core hypothesis unvalidated (semantic baselines NEVER RUN)
2. Gap 6: Processor specs missing (LLMRenameProcessor needed for Phase 1)
3. Gap 3: Terminology inconsistent (anchor definition, processor naming)

Recommendation: Complete Gap Resolution Sprint before starting Phase 1 implementation
